The supplemental materials of "***Simulation-based Exploration for Aggregation Algorithms in Human+AI Crowd: What factors should we consider for better results***" 
in the [HCOMP2024](https://www.humancomputation.com/) Works-in-Progress and Demonstrations track.

## Overview
This repository contains the Python implementations of (1) the Human+AI Crowd Simulation model and (2) the DS+OneCoin model. 

I would like you to read  [`supplemental_materials.pdf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crowd4u/hcomp24-wip-tamura/main/supplemental_materials.pdf) first.
